    		<h1>ARIA accessibility project</h1>
				<p><time datetime="2013-11-08">November 8th, 2013</time>
          		<p> I worked on a website project recently that called for an accessibility audit 
				and follow-up code fixes to address problems with the site's treatment of content that 
				cycled through a carousel automatically.</p>
				
				<p>Scenario:  When users visit the "products" site, the page cycles through several hero 
				images without giving the user control over the component.  The cycle would start automatically - 
				paging through hero 1, hero 2, hero 3 and then back to hero 1.  The transition time was less than two 
				seconds and the hero images themselves would "sit" for five seconds.</p>
				
				<h2>Issues</h2>
				
				<aside><p>Content shouldn't cycle automatically (IMO) but the company's accessibility policies didn't forbid this implementation.</p></aside>
				  
    			<p>Issue 1:  Users are unable to start/stop the cycle.  This can be problematic for users that have conditions 
				that affect how quickly they can read or comprehend information.   The company does have accessibility polices against 
				this so, we had to make room in our spec to afford stop/start controls to users for this component.	</p>
					
				<p>Issue 2:  For visually impaired users or users that rely on <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr>, they may not notice that content was 
				changing on the site.  This could be problematic if these heroes included important product information or 
				links to product information that were otherwise not available to the end user.  The company also had policies 
				for content that was active or "live" on the site:  components need to tell the browser how many items were in 
				the series and which item was active.</p>
					
				<h2>Solution</h2>
				
				<p>Issue 1:  The component would be updated to allow users to stop the cycling of hero images on the 
				first click / tap.  We would expose this control (affordance) buy using the ubiquitous "dots" that users 
				are familiar with on other sites and mobile devices.  We would apply the accent color style to the active 
				dot and reminder would appear as hollow dots (disks). This would tell sighted users that there were three 
				heroes in the series and they were on number two of three.</p>	
					
				<p>Issue 2:  But what about <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr> users?  Dots won't help <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr> users, 
				we needed to have the browser tell the <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr> user that content was 
				changing and where they were in the cycle of updates.  We have decided to move forward with an update that uses 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA" title="More info on ARIA">ARIA</a> properties and 
				roles to help announce changes and identify where the user was in the sequence of cycling content.  We treat the region of the 
				cycling content as a live region with the following properties and values:</p>	
				
				<ul class="clean">
				<li><span class="code"> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-atomic" title="More info about Aria atomic">Aria-atomic="false"</a></span> - Atomic tells <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr> they should only announce updates within their region.</li>
				<li><span class="code"> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-setsize" title="More info about ARIA setsize">Aria-setsize="n"</a></span> - Tells <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr> the number of items in the series</li>	
				<li><span class="code"> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-posinset" title="More info about ARIA posinset">Aria-posinset="x"</a></span> - Tells <abbr title="Assistive Technologies">ATs</abbr> where an item falls in the series.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>I'll update the thread once we get through testing. I'm expecting a few changes to our current approach 
				once we know more about how it actually sounds in the wild.  Stay tuned.</p><br>

    		<h1>Lessons Learned about Lessons Learned</h1>
				<p><time datetime="2013-10-18">October 10th, 2013</time>
          		<p>PMI puts a lot of weight behind the value of using the lessons learned exercise during the closing of a project 
				or a project phase.  In my experience, most tech organizations don't allocate the time or put enough organizational 
				weight behind this practice. Worse still, many of these organizations fail to create a culture where this kind reflection 
				is valued.  Most companies will state that they do learn from previous mistakes through the organic optimization of their business 
				processes.  Their success is evident in their continuous improvement.  Even project contributors will tend to agree that problems 
				that would make into the Lessons Learned analysis are usually self-evident and don't require a heavy process burdened with forms, 
				meetings and the politics that tends to be confused with accountability.   What underlies these points is the truth that in most 
				organizations, the things that go wrong and the circumstances that cause them are not mysterious but are well known and accepted 
				day to day realities. Scope was under-costed because the contributors building the costing estimates didn't spend enough time 
				understanding the stamen of work.  The statement of work itself was ambiguous and inconsistent.  The risks that we prepared for 
				never surfaced and the risks that did come up were obscure and unexpected. Etc. Etc.</p>
				
				<p>What's misguided in this point of view is that it misses the value proposition that a Lessons Learned process makes the organization 
				stronger, more accountable and transparent by finding the hidden things - not just the obvious ones.  It's about not accepting the 
				evident issues at face value but digging deeper in the forces at work in your group, identifying the gaps in planning and the 
				organizational circumstances that make projects go sideways.  What's more, it helps connect the dots across you planning activities.  
				Quite often, I have found that an impactful nugget from lessons learned activity has resulted in changes that affected multiple areas 
				of project planning and budgeting.  It's not just about how to manage risk.</p>
				
				<p>I have never worked in an organization that could afford a facilitated Lessons Learned session.  I have picked up a few ideas 
				on how organize one for smaller projects that has served me well.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Start the Lessons Learned process during planning.  Budget time for meetings and analysis during critical planning and execution 
					phases - not just at closing.  Even if the objective is to take down descriptions of issues and gather data, it is important to make 
					time and set expectations early.</li>
					<li>Have a standardized input template.  As part of the organizational documents for your project, create a Lessons learned template 
					for everyone to use in capturing details in real time.  The template should be short and allow contributors to capture both good 
					and bad input.  The format I uses has four columns:  1) issue name, 2) what went well, 3) what went not-so-well, and 4) what should 
					we have done differently.  Having this as an outlook signature template makes it easy to capture this information.</li>
					<li>Always review old Lessons Learned during planning - If you don't have a database of lessons learned, start now and create one 
					with your next project.  Organize lessons learned into a spreadsheet or database by both project phases and process groups.  Consult 
					the DB during planning and use this information while shaping your approach on your next project.</li>
					<li>Make it safe for all contributors.  There is a lot of sensitivity about sharing things that go wrong with the group.  As a 
					project manager, you should make it safe and acceptable to be candid about issues that come up by 1) focusing on problems and 
					results not people, 2) avoiding the blame trap, 3) being first to offer up your own mistakes to demonstrate the value of 
					the process.</li>
					<li>Land the "Lessons" at closing.  Not every "Lesson" will be clear during execution.  As issues come into the Lessons Learned 
					tracking process, have someone on the team dedicated to synthesizing information as quickly as possible- but leave the rest for 
					closing.  During the closing phase, that's when you organize what's been learned and what needs to be fleshed out.  During the 
					Lessons Learned session, focus on what's missing or what the common themes are.</li>
					<li>Make recommendations.  The finishing touch is to make recommendations that come as a result of the Lessons Learned process.  
					This is where the PM can tell the complete story of what went well, what went wrong and what should be done differently next time.  
					Your audience should be management and sponsors, so make the points crisp and as quantitative as possible.  Don't forget to memorialize 
					process changes with your PMO or organizational process office.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>That's it - my rant on the value of Lessons Learned.  In the eight years of managing software and SEO projects, I have held many 
				lessons learned working sessions and my experience is that they get better over time.  Expect organizational resistance (another meeting, 
				another email, etc.) but after the process start to show improvements, you will start to gain support in management and among 
				your like-minded peers.</p>

    		<h1>Image Gallery 1</h1>
          		<p> I spend much of my down time exploring Seattle and our neighbouring cities.  When circumstances permit, I'll 
				take my camera and try to get as much photographic experience as I can - given Seattle's challenging light.  
				Here are a few examples of work from last year.</p>

    		<h1 id="pier">Washington's coast</h1>
          		<p>Seabrook is a small community of homes and rental cottages located near the northern Washington coast 
				(north of Grays Harbor).  The community has its own charm and is worth the time to plan afternoon shots that 
				would take advantage of the evening light.  During my visit however, I spent most of my time planning shots around 
				the coastline and the weathered exteriors of the older homes in neighboring communities. </p>
					
				<div class="img-table-inset">
						 	<p>This is one of several images I took using my Panasonic Lumix GF2 micro four thirds camera.  The morning fog obscured 
							the tidal boundary which made the subject of this composition more mysterious.  Originals were shot in color but the BW treatment 
							was more interesting.</p><br>

    		<h1 id="bullpen">The bullpen before the game</h1>
          		<p>One advantage with bringing a camera to a baseball game is that the stadium provides many 
				kinds of photo opportunities.  Even if you don't have the equipment to make the fast-motion shots work, 
				there are always other places and subjects that will give you an interesting shot.  Safeco Field in Seattle Washington 
				is a great place to bring a still camera whether it is for the architecture of the rolling roof, the carnival atmosphere 
				or the sports.</p>
					
				<div class="img-table-inset">
						 	<p>The "Pen" at Safeco is an open-air beer garden that faces the Mariners bull pen.  This shot was taken in the moments 
							before the starting pitcher took the field.  The guys seem focused and little light-hearted in this shot.  The BW treatment 
							was compensate for the brightness of the shot. </p>

    		<h1 id="tower">Art Deco in Beacon Hill</h1>
          		<p>This is one of the more unique buildings in Seattle.  It was originally built in 1933 as a hospital for military personnel.  
				It has since been a hospital the "poor and indigent" of Seattle and more recently the home of Amazon.com before it moved into 
				its offices in West Lake Union. It is still being used today as commercial property with some of the facility is being leased to 
				Seattle Central Community College. </p>
					
				<div class="img-table-inset">
						 	<p>This shot doesn't do this building justice.  It was taken hand held from the second tier of Safeco Filed. 
							You get a sense for the Art Deco style but to really appreciate it, you have to see it up close or at night 
							when the city fires up the architectural lighting for the entire building.  My goal is to someday get a good time lapse shot 
							of the building.</p>
